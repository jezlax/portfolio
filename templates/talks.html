    I've been lucky enough to speak about analytics and its role in sports at a number of venues over the years, including:<br>
    SXSW, Big Data Silicon Valley 2015, the Tableau Customer Conference, and serving as a judge in the Sloan Sports Analytics Conference Hackathon in 2018. <br>
    More recently, I've been able to speak to several graduate and undergraduate student groups at Universities like Virginia Tech, BYU, and University of Utah. <br> <br>
    Below you can find my talk from the Virginia Tech Sports Data Analytics Club from 2020, along with the accompanied google Colab notebook.
